# reactportfolio1

This is a portfolio showcasing the work I have done in the UCI coding bootcamp including several projects and homework assignments. 

In addition to these projects and homework assignments, I have provided links to the following:
-My Resume
-My Github
-My LinkedIn

On my Portfolio page, there are links to both the deployed version of the app/project as well as a link to the repos for all projects and apps on display. 

Having not known anything about coding two and a half months ago, I am proud of what I have put on display here. 

Hope you enjoy!
